Unit testing
Solving problems and implement tests for small code units

Unit testing is the low-level testing where developers verify that isolated sections of the code, called units, work as intended.

Unit tests are implemented during the coding phase, by developers, by isolating a part of the code to verify its correctness. 

For example, it can be isolating functions and write tests for these. The purpose of this is to make sure they work as intended. 

Finding problems and defects at this stage is important since they may cause delays and additional costs due to defect identification and correction later in the project.
